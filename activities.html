                    GRG is a strategy, role playing, and fighting game, and the objective 
                    of the game is to survive, gain wealth, and to participate in the 
                    social structure of the game. 
                    There are multiple roles in the game ranging from council members and 
                    guards to barbarians and peasants, each with their own goals and tasks 
                    as well as benefits and deficites. 
                    The game is, in essense, a functioning town; if governed and supported 
                    properly, it will allow players to prosper and get rich easily, and if 
                    not, will lead to a lot of money being lost and a lot of people dieing. 
                    Imagine a small social structure trying to function with its own power 
                    structure, economic system, and legal system able to be manipulated 
                    and altered.

                    Zo is a very difficult duel-based fighting game where you can choose 
                    from 3 different weapons and fight other players to the death. 
                    Every direct hit on an opponent is an instant kill, and timing is 
                    very crucial to combat.
                    There is a steep learning curve and the game offers a very brutal 
                    playstyle, throwing you right into combat as you start playing the 
                    game with no tutorials or help menus to offer. 
                    Combat is very intense, and playing this game keeps you on edge 
                    the entire time, making for a very engaging and immersing 
                    experience.

                    I find criminal psychology to be very intriguing to me due to the mysterious and bizzare nature of many of the 
                    cases that you can find. 
                    The case of Casey Anthony specifically details the story of a young mother reporting her child to the police as 
                    missing after around a month of her child being out of her care.  
                    As the investigation goes on, her behavior and demeanor through said investigation. 
                    Many suspected the mother as the suspect of the crime, as there was considerable evidence found on her computers 
                    search results, as well as testimonies from others who interacted with her. 
                    The case was closed with Casey being claimed innocent in court, but the case is still quite odd and seemingly 
                    incomplete after the fact when you look into the details.
