                    GRG is a strategy, role playing, and fighting game, and the objective 
                    of the game is to survive, gain wealth, and to participate in the 
                    social structure of the game. 
                    There are multiple roles in the game ranging from council members and 
                    guards to barbarians and peasants, each with their own goals and tasks 
                    as well as benefits and deficites. 
                    The game is, in essense, a functioning town; if governed and supported 
                    properly, it will allow players to prosper and get rich easily, and if 
                    not, will lead to a lot of money being lost and a lot of people dieing. 
                    Imagine a small social structure trying to function with its own power 
                    structure, economic system, and legal system able to be manipulated 
                    and altered.

                    Zo is a very difficult duel-based fighting game where you can choose 
                    from 3 different weapons and fight other players to the death. 
                    Every direct hit on an opponent is an instant kill, and timing is 
                    very crucial to combat.
                    There is a steep learning curve and the game offers a very brutal 
                    playstyle, throwing you right into combat as you start playing the 
                    game with no tutorials or help menus to offer. 
                    Combat is very intense, and playing this game keeps you on edge 
                    the entire time, making for a very engaging and immersing 
                    experience.

                    One form of meditation I regularly practice is zen meditation.
                    The goal is to achieve a state of grounded focus where your mind 
                    is completely silent, which is called a state of zen.
                    It may take you a while to get the hang of the boredom of this 
                    meditation at first, but after a while you will start to learn 
                    how to experience a state of peaceful bliss everyday.
                    Another form of meditation i practice is called Vipassana. 
                    In essense, you label what your thoughts are during meditation, 
                    and then break from your meditation to contemplate on the 
                    thoughts before returning back to the meditation. 
                    This is a good meditation for those who find it hard to find 
                    order in their own minds, as well as those experiencing chaos, 
                    and helps with self-understanding and introspection.
