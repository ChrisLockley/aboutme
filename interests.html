                    I enjoy studying military strategy because many principles 
                    of military strategy and large-scale battle  can be 
                    practically applied to our daily lives and how we carry 
                    ourselves. 
                    The battle of leuctra was a military conflict taking place 
                    in 371 bce between an attacking force of spartan foot soldiers 
                    and a defending force of boeotian and theban warriors. 
                    The general facing the spartans, names Epaminondas, decided 
                    to attack the spartans weakest point as they advanced, dividing 
                    their armies and causing them to retreat and lose the battle. 
                    This shows that even if we are at our prime and the most 
                    competant in the room, a smart enemy will use your weaknesses, 
                    and that one should never try to invest themselves fully into 
                    one way of life.
                    Failure in this area even once could spell an end to everything 
                    else, and it teaches us to always stay open minded and adaptable 
                    in our success.

                    Epistemology, which is the study of the mechanisms and properties of how we aquire knowledge, is something I draw 
                    lots of my interest in philosophy from. Plato, Greek Philosopher and founder of the Athenian School of Thought, 
                    posited a thought experiment about a cave. 
                    This cave was housing people who were only ever shown shadows of images onto a wall that they faced, and one day, 
                    one of the people escape the cave to discover the real world. As they returned and inform the people in the cave 
                    of what they saw, the people could not believe what they were hearing from the other person because of their 
                    limited way of percieving the world.
                    Thought experiments like this were what first got me invested in philosophy, and itâ€™s why I love epistemology 
                    above all others as well.

                    I find criminal psychology to be very intriguing to me due to the mysterious and bizzare nature of many of the 
                    cases that you can find. 
                    The case of Casey Anthony specifically details the story of a young mother reporting her child to the police as 
                    missing after around a month of her child being out of her care.  
                    As the investigation goes on, her behavior and demeanor through said investigation. 
                    Many suspected the mother as the suspect of the crime, as there was considerable evidence found on her computers 
                    search results, as well as testimonies from others who interacted with her. 
                    The case was closed with Casey being claimed innocent in court, but the case is still quite odd and seemingly 
                    incomplete after the fact when you look into the details.
