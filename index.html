                Welcome to my website! My name is Christian Lockley, but most people call me Chris, 
                and this website will be about my interests, what I like to do, and what it’s like 
                where I’m living at. I will be allowing you to take a step into my world of thoughts,
                and I might even teach you a few things while you visit this site. I’m someone who 
                enjoys thinking, and I’m someone who appreciates art and artistry in the world. I
                enjoy philosophy, and I study military strategy and epistemology personally for 
                thought experimenting and educational purposes, as I love to develop my depth and 
                range of thought. Hopefully through this website I can show you what captivates me, 
                why it does, and what I am experiencing around me in my area.
